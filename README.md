# Spike2-Scripts

Spike-Delay (31/07/2020):
This Spike2-script measures the delay between two events in separate channels. To extract events from a recording (waveform channel) the Spike2-software offers several searching mode: peak (maximum detection), through (minimum detection), signal rising through a level and signal falling through a level. After event-extraction from your recordings, you can use this script to measure the delay in a semi-automatic manner. Additional functions were included into this script, like opening of a new file and saving the results. In our study, we used this script to measure the delay of a propagating action potential between two recording sites of one abdominal nerve in Drosophila larva for analysis of the conduction velocity.
